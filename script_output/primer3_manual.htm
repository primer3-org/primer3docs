<h2><a name="introduction">2. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p>Primer3 picks primers for PCR reactions, considering as criteria:
<br>
o oligonucleotide melting temperature, size, GC content,
  and primer-dimer possibilities,<br>
<br>
o PCR product size,<br>
<br>
o positional constraints within the source (template) sequence, and<br>
<br>
o possibilities for ectopic priming (amplifying the wrong sequence)<br>
<br>
o many other constraints.<br>
<br>
All of these criteria are user-specifiable as constraints, and
some are specifiable as terms in an objective function that
characterizes an optimal primer pair.<br>
<br>

<h2><a name="contact">4. REPORTING BUGS AND PROBLEMS AND SUGGESTING ENHANCEMENTS</a></h2>

<h2><a name="licenseExplain">5. FAIR USE OF PRIMER3</a></h2>

<p>In this section the developers would like to explain how they 
would like primer3 to be used. Some of the things written here 
might be in  conflict with the GPL license. In all this cases 
the GPL is the legally binding license and issues of this 
section can be ignored.<br>
<br>
The development of primer3 is promoted by a small group of 
enthusiastic scientists mainly in their free time. We do not gain 
any financial profit with primer3.<br>
<br>
There are two groups of primer3 users, the end user, who runs 
primer3 to pick its primers and the programmer, who uses primer3 
in his scripts or his software package. We encourage both to use 
primer3.<br>
<br>
If you are an end user, we as scientists would be very happy if 
once, when you write an article, you include in the Material and 
Method section the sentence "Primers were selected using 
primer3." and reference to our article. First of all, everybody 
likes to be cited, it gives us a feeling how many people use 
primer3 and that our efforts are actually useful to somebody 
else. Furthermore other scientists reading your article could 
get interested in primer3 and use it as well in the future. 
This is the best way to say "thank you" to us. Be aware that 
there is no need to ask us for permission if you install 
primer3, primer3web or primer3plus on your machine.<br>
<br>
If you are a programmer, you probably know the conditions of the 
GPL well. Be aware of its "viral" character. If you include 
parts of the primer3 code or the library in your software, you 
have to release your software also under GPL license. If you 
only call primer3 from your software and interpret its output, 
you can use any license you want for your software. If you 
modify primer3, you have to release your modifications in source 
code under GPL license as well.<br>
We choose the GPL license, because we wanted prime3 to evolve 
and that improvements find their way back into the main 
distribution of primer3. So if you make useful enhancements, 
please send us the code. If you are programming a new web 
interface which runs primer3, please include in the about page 
of the tool the sentence "&lt;you software name&gt; uses primer3 
version ...". Please consider releasing your software under GPL 
license as well, especially if you do not want to maintain it 
in the future. Be aware that there is no need to ask us for 
permission if you like to include our software in your tools, 
but we would be happy to receive an e-mail to inform us about 
your tool. If there are any issues / bugs / suggestions for 
primer3, please let us know so we can improve it.</p>

<h2><a name="installLinux">6. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS - UNIX/LINUX</a></h2>

<p>Unzip and untar the distribution.<br>
<br>
DO NOT do this on a PC -- primer3_core will not compile if pc
newlines get inserted into the source files.  Instead, move the
distribution (primer3_<release>.tar.gz) to Unix/Linux, and then<br>
<br>
$ unzip primer3_1.0.1.tar.gz<br>
$ tar xvf primer3_1.0.1.tar<br>
$ cd primer3_1.0.1/src<br>
<br>
If you do not use gcc, modify the makefile to
  use your (ANSI) C compiler and appropriate 
  compile and link flags.<br>
<br>
$ make all<br>
<br>
# Warnings about pr_release being unused are harmless.<br>
# You should have created executables primer3_core, ntdpal,<br>
# olgotm, and long_seq_tm_test<br>
<br>
$ make test<br>
<br>
# You should not see 'FAILED' during the tests.<br>
<br>
If your perl command is not called perl (for example, if it is
called perl5) you will have to modify the 
Makefile in the test/ directory.<br>
<br>
ntdpal (NucleoTide Dynamic Programming ALignment) is a
stand-alone program that provides primer3's alignment
functionality (local, a.k.a. Smith-Waterman, global,
a.k.a. Needleman-Wunsch, plus "half global").  It is provided
strictly as is; for further documentation please see the code.</p>

<h2><a name="installMac">7. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS - OSX</a></h2>

<p>How to install this software<br>
============================<br>
<br>
1.  Double click on the .tar.gz file to extract the archive.<br>
<br>
2.  The binary files are located in the 'bin' [for 'binary'] 
    folder<br>
<br>
3.  (Optional) To run the tests, cd to the new directory and 
    then the test folder<br>
<br>
4.  (Optional) Within this folder run:
	a. 'perl -w p3test.pl'<br>
<br>
5.  (Optional) You should not see 'FAILED' during the tests.<br>
<br>
6.  (Optional) *NOTE*:  If your perl command is not called 
    perl (for example, if it is called perl5) you will have 
    to modify the internals of the test scripts).<br>
<br>
7.	Copy the following files to a location of your choice:<br>
	a.  bin/long_seq_tm_test<br>
	b.  bin/ntdpal<br>
	c.  bin/oligotm<br>
	d.  bin/primer3_core<br>
<br>
8.	(Optional) Make sure this location is within your $PATH 
    (see below)<br>
<br>
<br>
Where to put the binary files<br>
=============================<br>
<br>
A good place to put these is within ~/bin/ (this means in 
your home folder, within a folder named `bin` [for 'binary']).<br>
<br>
You can also just drag the 'bin' folder to a location within 
your home directory.<br>
<br>
You can certainly also copy the files within 'bin' to 
/usr/local/bin (if you are an administrator) or another 
similar location.<br>
<br>
You may need to adjust the permissions on the binaries if 
you get fancy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Add the location to your $PATH<br>
==============================<br>
<br>
This is an optional step, but it will allow you to run 
primer3 in any directory on your machine as your user just 
by typing its name (primer3_core).<br>
<br>
*** You should be very careful when altering your $PATH as 
things can go very wrong.  See below for an alternate 
method. *** <br>
<br>
If you added the binaries to /usr/local/bin, then you do 
not need to do this.<br>
<br>
If you added the binaries to a local directory (let's say 
~/bin/), do the following:<br>
<br>
	1.  Edit your ~/.bash_profile.  You can edit this on 
        the command line (Terminal) with:<br>
<br>
		nano ~/.bash_profile<br>
<br>
	2. Add the following line if it is not present 
       (replacing '~/bin' if you used another directory):<br>
<br>
		PATH=$PATH:~/bin/<br>
<br>
	3. If a PATH line *is* present, ensure you add a colon 
       to the end of what is there and then the directory, 
       so if you have something like:<br>
<br>
		a) PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/genome/bin:/sw/bin<br>
<br>
       make it look like:<br>
<br>
		b) PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/genome/bin:/sw/bin:~/bin<br>
<br>
	4. Quit and restart terminal for the changes to take 
       effect.<br>
<br>	
If you don't add the location to your $PATH<br>
===========================================<br>
<br>
Assuming you don't want to modify your $PATH, you can still 
run the binaries.  Let's assume you put the files in 
'~/bin/.  You may run primer3_core by doing either of the 
following:<br>
<br>
	1. ~/bin/primer3_core < yourInputFile<br>
	2. /Users/<your username>/bin/primer3_core < yourInputFile<br>
<br>
The first option is just a shortcut to the second.</p>

<h2><a name="installWindows">8. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS - WINDOWS</a></h2>

<p>How to install this software<br>
============================<br>
<br>
1. Unzip the '.zip' file downloaded from SourceForge.net<br>
2. You will create a primer3-1.1.3 folder in the location 
   where the file was unzipped<br>
3. You may copy the files from the 'bin' directory of the 
   primer3-1.1.3 folder to a location of your choice.  
   The exact same files are located within the 'src' folder 
   so that the tests may be run (windows does not allow 
   relative paths in shortcuts).<br>
<br>
Running the tests<br>
=================<br>
We are working on integrating the test suite to windows.  
However, substantial differences between windows and 
Unix/Linux require some differences in the test script.<br>
<br>
You must also install a perl distribution to run the 
windows tests.<br>
<br>
We *strongly* recommend you install ActiveState perl 
(http://www.activestate.com/products/activeperl/) 
as this was used to test our primer3 builds, and it is 
known to work.<br>
<br>
***The perl test script for windows has a different name, 
at the moment, than that for the unix/linux versions. See 
below.***<br>
<br>
1. Click on 'Start > Run...'<br>
2. Type 'cmd' into the space provided<br>
3. Hit enter (or select 'OK')<br>
4. Navigate to the location of the tests:<br>
<br>
    A. if you put it in <br>
    C:/Documents and Settings/YourName/primer3-1.1.3/test/,<br>
    you would type <br>
    'cd c:/Documents and Settings/YourName/primer3-1.1.3/test/'<br>
    <br>
    B. you can also type 'cd ' (don't forget the space 
    after cd) and drag the primer3-1.1.3 folder onto the 
    command-line window from windows explorer, this will 
    fill in the location for you<br>
<br>
5. On the command line, run 'perl p3testz.pl -w' in this 
   directory<br>
6. You should see [OK] for all of the tests.<br>
<br>
Running the software<br>
====================<br>
<br>
To run the program, you must do so from the MS-DOS 
command-line.  The intricacies of the DOS commandline are 
beyond the scope of this document.  Google for more 
information, if needed.  Here is a quick summary:<br>
<br>
1. Click on 'Start > Run...'<br>
2. Type 'cmd' into the space provided<br>
3. Hit enter (or select 'OK')<br>
4. Navigate to the location of the binary:<br>
<br>
    A. if you put it in<br>
    C:/Documents and Settings/YourName/Temp,<br>
    you would type <br>
    'cd c:/Documents and Settings/YourName/Temp'<br>
<br>
    B. you can also type 'cd ' (don't forget the space 
    after cd) and drag the primer3 folder onto the 
    command-line window from windows explorer, this will 
    fill in the location for you<br>
<br>
5. Run the example file by typing:<br>
<br>
    primer3_core.exe < example<br>
<br>
Other files may be run in a similar fashion.  If your input 
filename is 'MyData.txt' you can run primer3 using this 
file (in the correct format; see README) with:<br>
<br>
    primer3_core.exe < MyData.txt<br>
<br>
If your file is not in the folder containing 
primer3_core.exe, you could run the program from the 
primer3_core folder using:<br>
<br>
    primer3_core.exe < c:/someOtherFolder/someOtherFolder/MyData.txt<br>
<br>
Finally, if you want to run the program without going to 
its folder, assuming primer3_core.exe is in c:/Temp, you 
could run:<br>
<br>
    c:/Temp/primer3_core.exe < c:/someOtherFolder/someOtherFolder/MyData.txt</p>

<h2><a name="buildOsX">9. BUILDING OSX UNIVERSAL BINARY</a></h2>

<p>** To build a processor-native, non-universal binary of primer3, 
the following is unneccesary**.<br>
<br>
The instructions above should be sufficient.<br>
<br>
A pre-compiled, universal binary download for OSX is available from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/primer3/ for the current release.<br>
<br>
These instructions assume you want to build binaries compatible 
with *both* of the current processor architectures used by the Apple
platform (i,e. the binaries will be run on both PPC and intel platforms).<br>
<br>
Provided you have the OS X developer tools installed
(you can download from http://developer.apple.com after
registering for a free account), you can compile a universal
build (intel and PPC native) of primer3.<br>
<br>
o you must be running OS X > 10.4 and should have the most
	recent version of XCode<br>
o run `make -f Makefile.OSX.Leopard all` if you run OS X 10.5<br>
o run `make -f Makefile.OSX.Tiger all` is you run OS X 10.4<br>
o run the tests as directed above<br>
<br>
Additional instructions for 'installing' the binaries may be found in
the README.OSX.txt.<br>
<br>
You should be able to compile a 3-way binary which includes PPC64 support 
(intel, PPC, PPC64) by adding the `-arch ppc64` flag to the 
end of both the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS lines at the top of Makefile.OSX.  
This has not been tested.</p>

<h2><a name="systemRequirements">10. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</a></h2>

<p>Please see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/primer3/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/primer3/</a> for up-to-date
information.  Primer3 should compile on any Linux/Unix system
including MacOS 10 and on other systems with POSIX C
(e.g. MSWindows).  The Makefile may need to be modified for
compilation with C compilers other than gcc.  Our hope is to
distribute binary for SourceForge in the near future.  Primer3
still uses many Kernighan-&-Richie-style function headers, so
you might have to force your compiler to accept them.</p>

<h2><a name="invokingPrimer3">11. INVOKING primer3_core</a></h2>

<p>By default, the executable program produced by the Makefile is
called primer3_core.  This is the C program that does the heavy
lifting of primer picking.  There is also a more user-friendly
web interface (distributed separately).<br>
<br>
The command line for primer3 is:<br>
<br>
primer3_core [ -format_output ] [ -strict_tags ] < input_file.txt<br>
<br>
A complete list of valid command line tags can be found in 
COMMAND LINE TAGS below.<br>
<br>
WARNING: primer3_core only reads its input on stdin, so the usual
unix convention of<br>
<br>
primer3_core input_file.txt<br>
<br>
*will not work*.  Primer3_core will just sit there forever
waiting for its input on stdin.</p>

<h2><a name="commandLineTags">12. COMMAND LINE TAGS</a></h2>

<p>This parameters are read from command line:</p>
<h3>-about</h3>
<p><p>This tag generates one line of output: primer3 release 1.1.2
and terminates the program. This allows scripts to 
query primer3 for its version.</p></p>

<h3>-format_output</h3>
<p><p>This tag indicates that primer3_core should generate
user-oriented (rather than program-oriented) output.</p></p>

<h3>-strict_tags</h3>
<p><p>This tag indicates that primer3_core should generate
a fatal error if there is any tag in the input that
it does not recognize (see INPUT AND OUTPUT CONVENTIONS).</p></p>

<h3>-p3_settings_file=set.txt</h3>
<p><p>This tag allows to specify a settings file set.txt. The global 
("PRIMER_...") parameters of these file are read first. 
Tags appearing in the settings file override identical 
tags of the default primer3 settings and are modified 
by identical tags in the command line input. See 
primer3 file documentation for details on the file 
format.</p></p>

<h3>-io_version=XXX</h3>
<p><p>This tag indicated were XXX is the version of input primer3 should 
read. At the moment only -io_version=3 and -io_version=4
are supported. Please note that -io_version=4 is required
to use new functionality.</p></p>

<h3>-2x_compat</h3>
<p><p>This tag is no longer supported.</p></p>


<h2><a name="inputOutputConventions">13. INPUT AND OUTPUT CONVENTIONS</a></h2>

<p>By default, primer3 accepts input in Boulder-io format, a
pre-XML, pre-RDF, text-based input/output format for
program-to-program data interchange.  By default, primer3 also
produces output in the same format.<br>
<br>
When run with the -format_output command-line flag, primer3
prints a more user-oriented report for each sequence.<br>
<br>
Primer3 exits with 0 status if it operates correctly.  See EXIT
STATUS CODES below for additional information.<br>
<br>
The syntax of the version of Boulder-io recognized by primer3 is
as follows:<br>
<pre>
  o Input consists of a sequence of RECORDs.

  o A RECORD consists of a sequence of (TAG,VALUE) pairs, each terminated
    by a newline character (\n). A RECORD is terminated by  '='
    appearing by itself on a line.

  o A (TAG,VALUE) pair has the following requirements:

    o the TAG must be immediately (without spaces) 
          followed by '='.
    o the pair must be terminated by a newline character.
</pre>
An example of a legal (TAG,VALUE) pair is<br>
<br>
<a href="#SEQUENCE_ID">SEQUENCE_ID</a>=my_marker<br>
<br>
and an example of a BOULDER-IO record is<br>
<br>
<a href="#SEQUENCE_ID">SEQUENCE_ID</a>=test1<br>
<a href="#SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</a>=GACTGATCGATGCTAGCTACGATCGATCGATGCATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTGCTAGC<br>
=<br>
<br>
Many records can be sent, one after another. Below is an example
of three different records which might be passed through a
boulder-io stream:<br>
<br>
<a href="#SEQUENCE_ID">SEQUENCE_ID</a>=test1<br>
<a href="#SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</a>=GACTGATCGATGCTAGCTACGATCGATCGATGCATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTGCTAGC<br>
=<br>
<a href="#SEQUENCE_ID">SEQUENCE_ID</a>=test2<br>
<a href="#SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</a>=CATCATCATCATCGATGCTAGCATCNNACGTACGANCANATGCATCGATCGT<br>
=<br>
<a href="#SEQUENCE_ID">SEQUENCE_ID</a>=test3<br>
<a href="#SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</a>=NACGTAGCTAGCATGCACNACTCGACNACGATGCACNACAGCTGCATCGATGC<br>
=<br>
<br>
Primer3 reads boulder-io on stdin and echos its input and returns
results in boulder-io format on stdout.  Primer3 indicates many
user-correctable errors by a value in the <a href="#PRIMER_ERROR">PRIMER_ERROR</a> tag (see
below) and indicates other errors, including system configuration
errors, resource errors (such out-of-memory errors), and detected
programming errors by a message on stderr and a non-zero exit
status.<br>
<br>
Below is the list of input tags that primer3 recognizes.
Primer3 echos and ignores any tags it does not recognize, unless
the -strict_tags flag is set on the command line, in which case
primer3 prints an error in the <a href="#PRIMER_ERROR">PRIMER_ERROR</a> output tag (see
below), and prints additional information on stdout; this option
can be useful for debugging systems that incorporate primer.<br>
<br>
Except for tags with the type "interval list" each tag is allowed
only ONCE in any given input record.  This restriction is not
systematically checked in this beta release: use care.<br>
<br>
There are 2 major classes of input tags,  "Sequence" input tags
and "Global" input tags as described below.</p>

<h2><a name="migrateTags">14. HOW TO MIGRATE TAGS TO VERSION 4</a></h2>

<p>From primer3 v2.0 many tags were modified and new tags 
were introduced. The new primer3 tags are designed with the 
idea in mind that not humans use primer3, but computer scripts 
and other programs. The modifications make it easier for 
programmers to read the output and write the input for primer3.<br>
<br>
For temporal backward compartibility a flag can be set at 
command line (-io_version=3) which allows the use of the "old" 
primer3 tags. Please be aware that the new functionality is 
not available with the old tags. Furthermore the primer3 default 
values have changed in version 2.0. We strongly recomment to 
adapt your software to the new tags because this backward 
compartibility might be dropped in the next versions.<br>
<br>
There are three classes of input: "Sequence" input tags describe 
a particular input sequence to primer3, and are reset after 
every boulder record (now starting with SEQUENCE_).  "Global" 
input tags describe the general parameters that primer3 should 
use in its searches, and the values of these tags persist 
between input boulder records until or unless they are 
explicitly reset (now starting with PRIMER_). "Program" 
parameters that deal with the behavior of the primer3 program 
itself (now starting with P3_). See below for a list of the 
modified tags.<br>
<br>
The handling of PRIMER_TASK changed completely. In the past we 
used it to tell primer3 what task to perform. Now the task is 
complemented with <a href="#PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER">PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER</a>, 
<a href="#PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO">PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO</a> and <a href="#PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER">PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER</a>, which 
specify which primers are to be picked.<br>

OUTPUT TAGS:<br>
<br>
There are three big changes on the output:<br>
- INTERNAL_OLIGO is now replaced by INTERNAL.<br>
- The first version is numbered 0.<br>
- The "PRODUCT" tags are renamed<br>
<br>
Now all primer related output follows the rule:
PRIMER_{LEFT,RIGHT,INTERNAL,PAIR}_<j>_<tag_name>.
where <j> is an integer from 0 to n, where n is at most the 
value of <a href="#PRIMER_NUM_RETURN">PRIMER_NUM_RETURN</a> - 1.<br>
<br>
This allows easy scripting by using the underscores _ to split 
the name. The first part is PRIMER, the second the type of oligo 
or pair parameters, the third is always a number, starting at 
0 and the rest is used by the tags.<br>
<br>
That affects also (shown for output nr. 5):<br>

<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_ID">SEQUENCE_ID (string; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>An identifier that is reproduced in the output to enable users to
identify the source of the chosen primers.<br>
<br>
This tag must be present if <a href="#P3_FILE_FLAG">P3_FILE_FLAG</a> is non-zero.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE (nucleotide sequence; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>The sequence from which to choose primers.  The sequence
must be presented 5' -> 3' (see the discussion of the
<a href="#PRIMER_SELF_END">PRIMER_SELF_END</a> argument).  The bases may be upper or lower case.
No newlines should be inserted into the sequence, because the
Boulder-IO parser will assume that a line ends at a newline.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION">SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION (interval list; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>A sub-region of the given sequence in which to pick primers.  For
example, often the first dozen or so bases of a sequence are
vector, and should be excluded from consideration. The value for
this parameter has the form
<pre>
<tt><i>&lt;start&gt;</i></tt>,<tt><i>&lt;length&gt;</i></tt>
</pre>
where <tt><i>&lt;start&gt;</i></tt> is the index of the first base to consider,
and <tt><i>&lt;length&gt;</i></tt> is the number of subsequent bases in the
primer-picking region.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_TARGET">SEQUENCE_TARGET (interval list; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>If one or more Targets is specified then a legal primer pair must
flank at least one of them.  A Target might be a simple sequence
repeat site (for example a CA repeat) or a single-base-pair
polymorphism.  The value should be a space-separated list of
<pre>
<tt><i>&lt;start&gt;</i></tt>,<tt><i>&lt;length&gt;</i></tt>
</pre>
pairs where <tt><i>&lt;start&gt;</i></tt> is the index of the first base of a
Target, and <tt><i>&lt;length&gt;</i></tt> is its length.

For backward compatibility primer3 accepts (but ignores)
a trailing ,<description> for each element of this argument.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_EXCLUDED_REGION">SEQUENCE_EXCLUDED_REGION (interval list; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>Primer oligos may not overlap any region specified in this tag.
The associated value must be a space-separated list of
<pre>
<tt><i>&lt;start&gt;</i></tt>,<tt><i>&lt;length&gt;</i></tt>
</pre>
pairs where <tt><i>&lt;start&gt;</i></tt> is the index of the first base of
the excluded region, and <tt><i>&lt;length&gt;</i></tt> is its length.  This tag is
useful for tasks such as excluding regions of low sequence
quality or for excluding regions containing repetitive elements
such as ALUs or LINEs.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_INTERNAL_EXCLUDED_REGION">SEQUENCE_INTERNAL_EXCLUDED_REGION (interval list; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>Middle oligos may not overlap any region specified by this tag.
The associated value must be a space-separated list of

<start>,<length>

pairs, where <start> is the index of the first base of
an excluded region, and <length> is its length.  Often one would
make Target regions excluded regions for internal oligos.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_PRIMER">SEQUENCE_PRIMER (nucleotide sequence; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>The sequence of a left primer to check and around which to design
right primers and optional internal oligos.  Must be a substring
of <a href="#SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</a>.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_INTERNAL_OLIGO">SEQUENCE_INTERNAL_OLIGO (nucleotide sequence; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>The sequence of an internal oligo to check and around which to
design left and right primers.  Must be a substring of SEQUENCE.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_PRIMER_REVCOMP">SEQUENCE_PRIMER_REVCOMP (nucleotide sequence; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>The sequence of a right primer to check and around which to
design left primers and optional internal oligos.  Must be a
substring of the reverse strand of <a href="#SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</a>.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_START_CODON_POSITION">SEQUENCE_START_CODON_POSITION (int; default -1000000)</a></h3>

<p>This parameter should be considered EXPERIMENTAL at this point.
Please check the output carefully; some erroneous inputs might
cause an error in primer3.<br>
<br>
Index of the first base of a start codon.  This parameter allows
primer3 to select primer pairs to create in-frame amplicons
e.g. to create a template for a fusion protein.  Primer3 will
attempt to select an in-frame left primer, ideally starting at or
to the left of the start codon, or to the right if necessary.
Negative values of this parameter are legal if the actual start
codon is to the left of available sequence. If this parameter is
non-negative primer3 signals an error if the codon at the
position specified by this parameter is not an ATG.  A value less
than or equal to -10^6 indicates that primer3 should ignore this
parameter.<br>
<br>
Primer3 selects the position of the right primer by scanning
right from the left primer for a stop codon.  Ideally the right
primer will end at or after the stop codon.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_QUALITY">SEQUENCE_QUALITY (quality list; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>A list of space separated integers. There must be exactly
one integer for each base in <a href="#SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</a> if this argument is
non-empty.  For example, for the sequence ANNTTCA...
<a href="#SEQUENCE_QUALITY">SEQUENCE_QUALITY</a> might be 45 10 0 50 30 34 50 67 ....
High numbers indicate high confidence in the base called at
that position and low numbers indicate low confidence in the
base call at that position.  This parameter is only relevant
if you are using a base calling program that provides
quality information (for example phred).</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_FORCE_LEFT_START">SEQUENCE_FORCE_LEFT_START (int; default -1)</a></h3>

<p>Forces the 5' end of the left primer to be at the indicated 
position. Primers are also picked if they violate certain
constrains.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_FORCE_LEFT_END">SEQUENCE_FORCE_LEFT_END (int; default -1)</a></h3>

<p>Forces the 3' end of the left primer to be at the indicated 
position. Primers are also picked if they violate certain
constrains.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_FORCE_RIGHT_START">SEQUENCE_FORCE_RIGHT_START (int; default -1)</a></h3>

<p>Forces the 5' end of the left primer to be at the indicated 
position. Primers are also picked if they violate certain
constrains.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_FORCE_RIGHT_END">SEQUENCE_FORCE_RIGHT_END (int; default -1)</a></h3>

<h2><a name="globalTags">16. "GLOBAL" INPUT TAGS</a></h2>

<p>"Global" input tags start with PRIMER_... and describe the 
general parameters that primer3 should use in its searches. 
The values of these tags persist between input boulder 
records until or unless they are explicitly reset. Errors 
in "Global" input tags are fatal because they invalidate 
the basic conditions under which primers are being picked.<br>
<br>
Because the laboratory detection step using internal oligos is 
independent of the PCR amplification procedure, internal oligo 
tags have defaults that are independent of the parameters that 
govern the selection of PCR primers. For example, the melting 
temperature of an oligo used for hybridization might be 
considerably lower than that used as a PCR primer.

<p>Probably the most important Tag. It tells primer3 what task to perform.
Legal values are:<br>
<br>
   <tt><i>pick_detection_primers</i></tt><br>
<br>
   Pick primers to detect a sequence (the classic primer3 task). Use 
   the <a href="#PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER">PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER</a>, <a href="#PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO">PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO</a> and 
   <a href="#PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER">PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER</a> to control which primers are picked.
   If <a href="#PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER">PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER</a> and <a href="#PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER">PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER</a> are 
   selected primer3 tries to pick primer pairs.<br>
<br>
   <tt><i>check_primers</i></tt><br>
<br>
   Primer3 does not pick any primers, it only checks the primers 
   provided in <a href="#SEQUENCE_PRIMER">SEQUENCE_PRIMER</a>, <a href="#SEQUENCE_INTERNAL_OLIGO">SEQUENCE_INTERNAL_OLIGO</a> and 
   <a href="#SEQUENCE_PRIMER_REVCOMP">SEQUENCE_PRIMER_REVCOMP</a>. Its the only task which does not
   require a sequence. If the sequence is provided, it is used
   as a template.<br>
<br>
   <tt><i>pick_primer_list</i></tt><br>
<br>
   Pick all primers in the sequence or limited by included region.
   It returns the primers sorted by quality starting with the 
   best primers. If <a href="#PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER">PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER</a> and 
   <a href="#PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER">PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER</a> is selected primer3 does not to pick 
   primer pairs but treats it as independent lists.<br>

   <tt><i>pick_sequencing_primers</i></tt><br>
<br>
   Pick primers suited to sequence a region. <a href="#SEQUENCE_TARGET">SEQUENCE_TARGET</a> can be

<h3><a name="PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER">PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER (boolean; default 1)</a></h3>

<p>If the associated value is 1 (non-0), then primer3 will attempt to
pick left primers.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO">PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO (boolean; default 0)</a></h3>

<p>If the associated value is 1 (non-0), then primer3 will attempt to
pick an internal oligo (hybridization probe to detect the PCR
product).</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER">PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER (boolean; default 1)</a></h3>

<p>If the associated value is 1 (non-0), then primer3 will attempt to
pick a right primer.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_NUM_RETURN">PRIMER_NUM_RETURN (int; default 5)</a></h3>

<p>The maximum number of primer (pairs) to return.  Primer pairs
returned are sorted by their &quot;quality&quot;, in other words by the
value of the objective function (where a lower number indicates a
better primer pair).  Caution: setting this parameter to a large
value will increase running time.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE">PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE (size range list; default 100-300)</a></h3>

<p>The associated values specify the lengths of the product that the
user wants the primers to create, and is a space separated list
of elements of the form
<pre>
<tt><i>&lt;x&gt;-&lt;y&gt;</i></tt>
</pre>
where an <tt><i>&lt;x&gt;-&lt;y&gt;</i></tt> pair is a legal range of lengths for the
product.  For example, if one wants PCR products to be between
100 to 150 bases (inclusive) then one would set this parameter to
<tt><i>100-150</i></tt>.  If one desires PCR products in either the range from
100 to 150 bases or in the range from 200 to 250 bases then one
would set this parameter to <tt><i>100-150 200-250</i></tt>.<br>
<br>
Primer3 favors ranges to the left side of the parameter string.
Primer3 will return legal primers pairs in the first range
regardless the value of the objective function for these pairs.
Only if there are an insufficient number of primers in the first
range will primer3 return primers in a subsequent range.<br>
<br>
For those with primarily a computational background,
the PCR product size is size (in base pairs) 
of the DNA fragment that would be produced by the
PCR reaction on the given sequence template.  This
would, of course, include the primers themselves.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_PRODUCT_OPT_SIZE">PRIMER_PRODUCT_OPT_SIZE (int; default 0)</a></h3>

<p>The optimum size for the PCR product.  0 indicates that there is
no optimum product size.  This parameter influences primer pair 
selection only if <a href="#PRIMER_PAIR_WT_PRODUCT_SIZE_GT">PRIMER_PAIR_WT_PRODUCT_SIZE_GT</a> or
<a href="#PRIMER_PAIR_WT_PRODUCT_SIZE_LT">PRIMER_PAIR_WT_PRODUCT_SIZE_LT</a> is non-0.<br>
This parameter increases calculation time, so set this only if 
you need a exact product size.</p>

the last term (after F. Baldino, Jr, M.-F. Chesselet, and M.E.
Lewis, Methods in Enzymology 168:766 (1989) eqn (1) on page 766

in Baldino et al. assume Na+ rather than K+.  According to
J.G. Wetmur, Critical Reviews in BioChem. and Mol. Bio. 26:227
(1991) 50 mM K+ should be equivalent in these formulae to .2 M
Na+.  Primer3 uses the same salt concentration value for
calculating both the primer melting temperature and the oligo

for hybridization later this behavior will not give you the Tm
under hybridization conditions.</p>

<p>The nanomolar (nM) concentration of annealing oligos in the PCR.
Primer3 uses this argument to calculate oligo melting 
temperatures.  The default (50nM) works well with the standard
protocol used at the Whitehead/MIT Center for Genome 
Research--0.5 microliters of 20 micromolar concentration for each
primer oligo in a 20 microliter reaction with 10 nanograms
template, 0.025 units/microliter Taq polymerase in 0.1 mM each
dNTP, 1.5mM MgCl2, 50mM KCl, 10mM Tris-HCL (pH 9.3) using 35
cycles with an annealing temperature of 56 degrees Celsius.  This
parameter corresponds to 'c' in equation (ii) of the paper
[Rychlik W, Spencer WJ and Rhoads
RE (1990) "Optimization of the annealing temperature for DNA
amplification in vitro", Nucleic Acids Res 18:6409-12

where a suitable value (for a
lower initial concentration of template) is "empirically
determined".  The value of this parameter is less than the actual
concentration of oligos in the reaction because it is the
concentration of annealing oligos, which in turn depends on the
amount of template (including PCR product) in a given cycle.
This concentration increases a great deal during a PCR;
fortunately PCR seems quite robust for a variety of oligo melting
temperatures.<br>

global alignments for candidate primers and primer pairs, Primer
assumes that the sequence from which to choose primers is
presented 5'->3'.  It is nonsensical to provide a larger value
for this parameter than for the Maximum (local) Complementarity

<p>Minimum number of base pairs between the 3' ends of any two left or ny

objective is get 'truly different' primer pairs.<br>
<br>
Primers that end at e.g.  30 and 31 have a three-prime distance of 1.<br>
<br>
-1 indicates a primer pair is ok if it has not already appeared in the

<h3><a name="PRIMER_SHOW_OLIGO_PROBLEMS">PRIMER_SHOW_OLIGO_PROBLEMS (boolean; default 0)</a></h3>

<p>If non-zero, cause the tags
PRIMER_{LEFT,RIGHT,INTERNAL_OLIGO_.._PROBLEMS, to be
generated.  These tags have empty arguments when there are
no problems with the corresponding oligo or primer, and
otherwise list the problems (constraint violations)
associated with primer or oligo that primer3 was forced to
choose (for example, as sometimes when <a href="#PRIMER_PICK_ANYWAY">PRIMER_PICK_ANYWAY</a>=1
and PRIMER...INPUT is specified).</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_LOWERCASE_MASKING">PRIMER_LOWERCASE_MASKING (int; default 0)</a></h3>

<p>This option allows for intelligent design of primers in sequence in
which masked regions (for example repeat-masked regions) are
lower-cased.  (New in v. 1.1.0, added by Maido Remm and Triinu
Koressaar)<br>
<br>
A value of 1 directs primer3 to reject primers overlapping
lowercase a base exactly at the 3' end.<br>
<br>
This property relies on the assumption that masked features
(e.g. repeats) can partly overlap primer, but they cannot overlap
the 3'-end of the primer.  In other words, lowercase bases at
other positions in the primer are accepted, assuming that the
masked features do not influence the primer performance if they
do not overlap the 3'-end of primer.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_EXPLAIN_FLAG">PRIMER_EXPLAIN_FLAG (boolean; default 0)</a></h3>

<p>If this flag is 1 (non-0), produce <a href="#PRIMER_LEFT_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_LEFT_EXPLAIN</a>,
<a href="#PRIMER_RIGHT_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_RIGHT_EXPLAIN</a>, and <a href="#PRIMER_INTERNAL_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_INTERNAL_EXPLAIN</a> output
tags, which are intended to provide information on the number of
oligos and primer pairs that primer3 examined, and statistics on
the number discarded for various reasons.  If -format_output is
set similar information is produced in the user-oriented output.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_LIBERAL_BASE">PRIMER_LIBERAL_BASE (boolean; default 0)</a></h3>

<p>This parameter provides a quick-and-dirty way to get primer3 to
accept IUB / IUPAC codes for ambiguous bases (i.e. by changing
all unrecognized bases to N).  If you wish to include an
ambiguous base in an oligo, you must set <a href="#PRIMER_NUM_NS_ACCEPTED">PRIMER_NUM_NS_ACCEPTED</a> to a
1 (non-0) value.<br>
<br>
Perhaps '-' and '* ' should be squeezed out rather than changed
to 'N', but currently they simply get converted to N's.  The authors
invite user comments.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_FIRST_BASE_INDEX">PRIMER_FIRST_BASE_INDEX (int; default 0)</a></h3>

<p>This parameter is the index of the first base in the input
sequence.  For input and output using 1-based indexing (such as
that used in GenBank and to which many users are accustomed) set
this parameter to 1.  For input and output using 0-based indexing
set this parameter to 0.  (This parameter also affects the
indexes in the contents of the files produced when the primer
file flag is set.)</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_MISPRIMING_LIBRARY">PRIMER_MISPRIMING_LIBRARY (string; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>The name of a file containing a nucleotide sequence library of
sequences to avoid amplifying (for example repetitive sequences, or
possibly the sequences of genes in a gene family that should
not be amplified.)  The file must be in (a slightly restricted)
FASTA format (W. B. Pearson and D.J. Lipman, PNAS 85:8 pp
2444-2448 [1988]); we briefly discuss the organization of this
file below.  If this parameter is specified then primer3 locally
aligns each candidate primer against each library sequence and
rejects those primers for which the local alignment score times a
specified weight (see below) exceeds <a href="#PRIMER_MAX_MISPRIMING">PRIMER_MAX_MISPRIMING</a>.
(The maximum value of the weight is arbitrarily set to 100.0.)<br>
<br>
Each sequence entry in the FASTA-format file must begin with an
"id line" that starts with '>'.  The contents of the id line is
"slightly restricted" in that primer3 parses everything after any
optional asterisk ('*') as a floating point number to use as the
weight mentioned above.  If the id line contains no asterisk then
the weight defaults to 1.0.  The alignment scoring system used is
the same as for calculating complementarity among oligos (e.g.
<a href="#PRIMER_SELF_ANY">PRIMER_SELF_ANY</a>), except for the handling of IUB/IUPAC ambiguity
codes (discussed below).<br>
<br>
The remainder of an entry contains the sequence as lines
following the id line up until a line starting with '>' or
the end of the file.  Whitespace and newlines are ignored.
Characters 'A', 'T', 'G', 'C', 'a', 't', 'g', 'c' and
IUB/IUPAC 'ambiguity' codes ('R, 'Y', 'K', 'M', 'S', 'W',
'N', including lower case) are retained. For technical
reasons the length of the sequence must be >= 3. Of course,
sequences of length < 10 or so are probably useless, but
will be accepted without complaint.<br>
<br>
WARNING: always set <a href="#PRIMER_LIB_AMBIGUITY_CODES_CONSENSUS">PRIMER_LIB_AMBIGUITY_CODES_CONSENSUS</a>=0
if any sequence in the library contains strings of 'N's:
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN.<br>
NOWWW<br>
There are no restrictions on line length.<br>
<br>
An empty value for this parameter indicates that no repeat
library should be used and "turns off" the use of a
previously specified library.<br>
<br>
Repbase (J. Jurka, A.F.A. Smit, C. Pethiyagoda, and
others, 1995-1996, <a href="ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repository/repbase">ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repository/repbase</a>)
is an excellent source of repeat sequences and pointers to the
literature. (The Repbase files need to be converted to Fasta
format before they can be used by primer3.)</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_INTERNAL_MISHYB_LIBRARY">PRIMER_INTERNAL_MISHYB_LIBRARY (string; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>Similar to <a href="#PRIMER_MISPRIMING_LIBRARY">PRIMER_MISPRIMING_LIBRARY</a>, except that the event we

in this library rather than priming from them.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_LIB_AMBIGUITY_CODES_CONSENSUS">PRIMER_LIB_AMBIGUITY_CODES_CONSENSUS (boolean; default 1)</a></h3>

<p>If set to 1, treat ambiguity codes as if they were consensus
codes when matching oligos to mispriming or mishyb
libraries. For example, if this flag is set, then a C in an
oligo will be scored as a perfect match to an S in a library
sequence, as will a G in the oligo. More importantly,
though, any base in an oligo will be scored as a perfect
match to an N in the library.  This is very bad if the
library contains strings of Ns, as no oligo will be legal
(and it will take a long time to find this out). So unless
you know for sure that your library does not have runs of Ns
(or Xs), then set this flag to 0.</p>

Here AU has to write more...</p>

<h2><a name="fileFormat">19. PRIMER3 FILE FORMAT</a></h2>

<p>Primer3 allows to save settings in a text file and load it 
upon program start. This allows to save and exchange settings 
tailored to special applications.<br>
<br>
To create a primer3 file a editor able to save txt files is 
sufficient. The three lines of the file have to be:
<pre>
Primer3 File - http://primer3.sourceforge.net
P3_FILE_TYPE=settings

P3_FILE_ID=Description of the settings
SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE=ATG...
...
...
...
=
</pre> 
In the first line "Primer3 File - http://primer3.sourceforge.net" 
without tailing space. In the second line "P3_FILE_TYPE=settings".
Valid values for P3_FILE_TYPE are all_parameters, sequence and 
settings. Up to now, only settings is supported. The third line 
has to be empty. It is strongly adviced to describe the settings 
using the P3_FILE_ID tag. It will print the description of the 
settings on the output. From the fourth line on regular 
boulder-io can be used as it is used in regular input. It also 
has to be terminated with a single "=". There can be only one 
input per file.</p>

<h2><a name="example">20. AN EXAMPLE</a></h2>

<p>One might be interested in performing PCR on an STS with a CA
repeat in the middle of it. Primers need to be chosen based on
the criteria of the experiment.<br>
<br>
We need to come up with a boulder-io record to send to primer3 via
stdin. There are lots of ways to accomplish this. We could save
the record into a text file called 'input', and then type the
UNIX command 'primer3 < input'.<br>
<br>
Let's look at the input record itself:

<br>
A breakdown of the reasoning behind each of the TAG=VALUE pairs
is below:<br>
<br>
<a href="#SEQUENCE_ID">SEQUENCE_ID</a>=example<br>
<br>
The main intent of this tag is to provide an identifier for the
sequence that is meaningful to the user, for example when primer3
processes multiple records, and by default this tag is optional.
However, this tag is _required_ when <a href="#P3_FILE_FLAG">P3_FILE_FLAG</a> is non-0
Because it provides the names of the files that contain lists
of oligos that primer3 considered.<br>

<br>
The <a href="#SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</a> tag is of ultimate importance. Without it, primer3
has no idea what to do. This sequence is 92 bases long. Note that
there is no newline until the sequence terminates completely.<br>
<br>
<a href="#SEQUENCE_TARGET">SEQUENCE_TARGET</a>=37,21<br>
<br>
There is a simple sequence repeat in our sequence, which starts
at base 37, and has a length of 21 bases. We want primer3 to
choose primers which flank the repeat site, so we let primer3 know
that we consider this site to be important.<br>
<br>
<a href="#PRIMER_TASK">PRIMER_TASK</a>=pick_detection_primers<br>
<br>
The <a href="#PRIMER_TASK">PRIMER_TASK</a> is of ultimate importance it tells primer3 which 
type of primers to pick. You can select typical primers for PCR 
detection, primers for cloning or for sequencing.<br>

<a href="#PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER">PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER</a>=1<br>
<a href="#PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO">PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO</a>=1<br>
<a href="#PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER">PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER</a>=1<br>
<br>
We would like to pick a left primer, a internal oligo and a 
right primer, so we set this flags to 1 (true). In combination 
with the <a href="#PRIMER_TASK">PRIMER_TASK</a> this tags control which primers are 
picked.<br>
<br>
<a href="#PRIMER_OPT_SIZE">PRIMER_OPT_SIZE</a>=18<br>
<br>
Since our sequence length is rather small (only 92 bases
long), we lower the <a href="#PRIMER_OPT_SIZE">PRIMER_OPT_SIZE</a> from 20 to 18. It's
more likely that primer3 will succeed if it shoots for smaller
primers with such a small sequence.<br>
<br>
<a href="#PRIMER_MIN_SIZE">PRIMER_MIN_SIZE</a>=15<br>
<a href="#PRIMER_MAX_SIZE">PRIMER_MAX_SIZE</a>=21<br>
<br>
With the lowering of optimal primer size, it's good to lower
the minimum and maximum sizes as well.<br>
<br>
<a href="#PRIMER_NUM_NS_ACCEPTED">PRIMER_NUM_NS_ACCEPTED</a>=1<br>
<br>
Again, since we've got such a small sequence with a
non-negligible amount of unknown bases (N's) in it, let's make
primer3's job easier by allowing it to pick primers that have
at most 1 unknown base.<br>
<br>
<a href="#PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE">PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE</a>=75-100<br>
<br>
We reduce the product size range from the default of 100-300
because our source sequence is only 108 base pairs long.  If we
insisted on a product size of 100 base pairs primer3 would have
few possibilities to choose from.<br>
<br>
<a href="#P3_FILE_FLAG">P3_FILE_FLAG</a>=1<br>
<br>
Since we've got such a small sequence, Primer might fail to
pick primers. We want to get the list of primers it
considered, then, so that we might manually pick primers
ourselves if Primer fails to do so. Setting this flag to 1
will force Primer to output the primers it considered to a
forward_primer and a reverse_primer output file.<br>
<br>
<a href="#PRIMER_INTERNAL_EXCLUDED_REGION">PRIMER_INTERNAL_EXCLUDED_REGION</a>=37,21<br>
<br>
Normally CA-repeats make poor hybridization probes (because they
not specific enough).  Therefor we exclude the CA repeat (which
is the TARGET) from consideration for the middle oligo.<br>
<br>
<a href="#PRIMER_EXPLAIN_FLAG">PRIMER_EXPLAIN_FLAG</a>=1<br>
<br>
We want to see statistics about the oligos and oligo triples
(left primer, internal oligo, right primer) that primer3
examined.<br>
<br>
=<br>
<br>
The '=' character terminates the record.<br>
<br>
There are some boulderio tags that we never even
specified. (<a href="#SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION">SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION</a>, <a href="#SEQUENCE_EXCLUDED_REGION">SEQUENCE_EXCLUDED_REGION</a>, 
et al.), which is perfectly legal.  For the tags with default 
values, those defaults will be used in the analysis. For the 
tags with NO default values (like <a href="#SEQUENCE_TARGET">SEQUENCE_TARGET</a>, for instance), the 
functionality requested by the those tags will simply be absent. 
It's not the case that we need to surround a simple sequence 
repeat every time we want to pick primers!</p>

<h2><a name="outputTags">21. OUTPUT TAGS</a></h2>

<p>For each boulderio record passed into primer3 via stdin, exactly
one boulderio record comes out of primer3 on stdout. These output
records contain everything that the input record contains, plus a
subset of the following tag/value pairs.  Unless noted by (*),
each tag appears for each primer pair returned.<br>
Tags are of the form PRIMER_{LEFT,RIGHT,INTERNAL,PAIR}_<j>_<tag_name>
where <j> is an integer from 0 to n, where n is at most the 
value of PRIMER_NUM_RETURN. In the documentation the output 
nr. 5 is shown as for example: PRIMER_LEFT_4_TM.<br>
<br>
In the descriptions below, 'i,n' represents a start/length pair,
's' represents a string, x represents an arbitrary integer, and f
represents a float.</p>
<h3><a name="PRIMER_ERROR">PRIMER_ERROR=s (*)</a></h3>

<p>s describes user-correctible errors detected in the input
(separated by semicolons).  This tag is absent if there are no
errors.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_LEFT">PRIMER_LEFT=i,n</a></h3>

<p>The selected left primer (the primer to the left in the input
sequence).  i is the 0-based index of the start base of the
primer, and n is t its length.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_RIGHT">PRIMER_RIGHT=i,n</a></h3>

<p>The selected right primer (the primer to the right in the input
sequence).  i is the 0-based index of the last base of the
primer, and n is its length.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_INTERNAL_OLIGO">PRIMER_INTERNAL_OLIGO=i,n</a></h3>

<p>The selected internal oligo. Primer3 outputs this tag if
PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO was non-0.  If primer3 fails to pick a
middle oligo upon request, this tag will not be output.  i is the
0-based index of start base of the internal oligo, and n is its
length.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE">PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE=x</a></h3>

<p>x is the product size of the PCR product.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_LEFT_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_LEFT_EXPLAIN=s (*)</a></h3>
<h3><a name="PRIMER_INTERNAL_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_INTERNAL_EXPLAIN=s (*)</a></h3>
<h3><a name="PRIMER_RIGHT_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_RIGHT_EXPLAIN=s (*)</a></h3>

<p>s is a (more or less) self-documenting string containing
statistics on the possiblities that primer3 considered in
selecting a single oligo.  For example

PRIMER_LEFT_EXPLAIN=considered 62, too many Ns 53, ok 9
PRIMER_RIGHT_EXPLAIN=considered 62, too many Ns 53, ok 9
PRIMER_INTERNAL_OLIGO_EXPLAIN=considered 87, too many Ns 39, overlap excluded region 40, ok 8

All the categories are exclusive, except the 'considered' category.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_PAIR_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_PAIR_EXPLAIN=s (*)</a></h3>

<p>s is a self-documenting string containing statistics on picking a
primer pair (plus internal oligo if requested).  For exaple

PRIMER_PAIR_EXPLAIN=considered 81, unacceptable product size 49, no internal oligo 32, ok 0

All the categories are exclusive, except the 'considered' category.

In some cases primer3 will examine a primer pair before it
discovers that one of the primers in the pair violates specified
constraints.  In this case PRIMER_PAIR_EXPLAIN might have a non-0
number 'considered', even though one or more of
PRIMER_LEFT_EXPLAIN, PRIMER_RIGHT_EXPLAIN, or
PRIMER_INTERNAL_OLIGO_EXPLAIN has 'ok 0'.</p>

P3_SHOW_OLIGO_PROBLEMS is true (non zero), and
primer3 was forced to choose a primer or oligo

<p>f is the maximum mispriming score for the right primer
against any sequence in the given PRIMER_MISPRIMING_LIBRARY;
s is the id of corresponding library sequence.
PRIMER_PAIR_MISPRIMING_SCORE is the maximum sum of

<h2><a name="cautions">24. CAUTIONS</a></h2>

<p>Some of the most important issues in primer picking can be
addressed only before using primer3. These are sequence quality 
(including making sure the sequence is not vector and not chimeric) 
and avoiding repetitive elements.<br>
<br>
Techniques for avoiding problems include a thorough understanding
of possible vector contaminants and cloning artifacts coupled
with database searches using blast, fasta, or other similarity
searching program to screen for vector contaminants and possible
repeats.  Repbase (J. Jurka, A.F.A. Smit, C. Pethiyagoda, and
others, 1995-1996, <a href="ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repository/repbase">ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repository/repbase</a>)
is an excellent source of repeat sequences and pointers to the
literature.  (The Repbase files need to be converted to Fasta format
before they can be used by primer3.) Primer3 now allows you to screen
candidate oligos against a Mispriming Library (or a Mishyb Library in
the case of internal oligos).<br>
<br>
Sequence quality can be controlled by manual trace viewing and
quality clipping or automatic quality clipping programs.  Low-
quality bases should be changed to N's or can be made part of
Excluded Regions. The beginning of a sequencing read is often
problematic because of primer peaks, and the end of the read
often contains many low-quality or even meaningless called bases.
Therefore when picking primers from single-pass sequence it is
often best to use the <a href="#SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION">SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION</a> parameter to 
ensure that primer3 chooses primers in the high quality region 
of the read.<br>
<br>
In addition, primer3 takes as input a <a href="#SEQUENCE_QUALITY">SEQUENCE_QUALITY</a> list for
use with those base calling programs (e.g. Phred, Bass/Grace, 
Trout) that output this information.</p>

<h2><a name="findNoPrimers">25. WHAT TO DO IF PRIMER3 CANNOT FIND ANY PRIMERS?</a></h2>

<p>Try relaxing various parameters, including the
self-complementarity parameters and max and min oligo melting
temperatures.  For example, for very A-T-rich regions you might
have to increase maximum primer size or decrease minimum melting
temperature.  It is usually unwise to reduce the minimum primer
size if your template is complex (e.g. a mammalian genome), since
small primers are more likely to be non-specific.  Make sure that
there are adequate stretches of non-Ns in the regions in which
you wish to pick primers.  If necessary you can also allow an N
in your primer and use an oligo mixture containing all four bases
at that position.<br>

this documentation was written by Richard Resnick and Steve Rozen, and
the original web interface was designed by Richard Resnick.  Lincoln
Stein championed the use of the Boulder-IO format and the idea of
making primer3 a software component.  In addition, among others, Ernst

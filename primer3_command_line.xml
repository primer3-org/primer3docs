An example Tag with all possible options:

<tag>
	<tagName></tagName>
	<description>
<![CDATA[<p> </p>]]>
	</description>
</tag>

	-->
<tag>
	<tagName>-about</tagName>
	<description>
<![CDATA[<p>With this argument primer3 generates one line of output
indicating the release number:
<pre>
primer3 release &lt;release number&gt;
</pre>
and then exits. This allows scripts to 
query primer3 for its version.</p>]]>
	</description>
</tag>
<tag>
	<tagName>-format_output</tagName>
	<description>
<![CDATA[<p>This argument indicates that primer3_core should generate
user-oriented (rather than program-oriented) output.</p>]]>
	</description>
</tag>
<tag>
	<tagName>-strict_tags</tagName>
	<description>
<![CDATA[<p>This argument indicates that primer3_core should generate
a fatal error if there is any tag in the input that
it does not recognize.</p>]]>
	</description>
</tag>
<tag>
	<tagName>-p3_settings_file=<i>file_path</i> </tagName>
	<description>
<![CDATA[<p>This argument specifies a settings file,
<i>file_path</i>. Primer3 reads the global 
("PRIMER_...") parameters from this file first. 
Tags appearing in the settings file override
default primer3 settings. The values set in
the settings files can be also overridden 
by tags in the input file. See
primer3 file documentation for details on the file 
format.</p>]]>
	</description>
</tag>
<tag>
	<tagName>-io_version=<i>n</i></tagName>
	<description>
<![CDATA[<p>This argument directs primer3 to use
io version <i>n</i> input and output conventions.
<i>n</i> can be 3 (for mostly backward
compatible behavior) or 4.
-io_version=4 is required to use functionality that 
is new in release 2.0.0 and later.</p>]]>

<tag>
	<tagName>-2x_compat</tagName>

<![CDATA[<p>This argument is no longer supported.</p>]]>

<tag>
        <tagName>-output=<i>file_path</i></tagName>

<![CDATA[<p>This argument specifies the file where the output
should be written. If omitted, stdout is used. </p>]]>

        <tagName>-error=<i>file_path</i></tagName>

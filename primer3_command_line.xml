INVOKING primer3_core
---------------------

By default, the executable program produced by the Makefile is
called primer3_core.  This is the C program that does the heavy
lifting of primer picking.  There is also a more user-friendly
web interface (distributed separately).

The command line for primer3 can be:

primer3_core [ -format_output ] [ -strict_tags ] < input_file.txt

WARNING: primer3_core only reads its input on stdin, so the usual
unix convention of

primer3_core input_file.txt

*will not work*.  Primer3_core will just sit there forever
waiting for its input on stdin.


Possible command line tags:

-about
   generates one line of output: primer3 release 1.1.2
   and terminates the program. This allows scripts to 
   query primer3 for its version.

-format_output 
   indicates that primer3_core should generate
   user-oriented (rather than program-oriented) output.

-strict_tags 
   indicates that primer3_core should generate
   a fatal error if there is any tag in the input that
   it does not recognize (see INPUT AND OUTPUT CONVENTIONS).
   
-p3_settings_file=set.txt
   allows to specify a settings file set.txt. The global 
   ("PRIMER_...") parameters of these file are read first. 
   Tags appearing in the settings file override identical 
   tags of the default primer3 settings and are modified 
   by identical tags in the command line input. See 
   primer3 file documentation for details on the file 
   format. 
   
-io_version=XXX
   indicated were XXX is the version of input primer3 should 
   read. At the moment only -io_version=3 and -io_version=4
   are supported. Please note that -io_version=4 is required
   to use new functionality.

-2x_compat 
   is no longer supported.

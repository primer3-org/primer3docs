<![CDATA[<p>Initial development of Primer3 was funded by Howard Hughes Medical
Institute and by the National Institutes of Health, National Human
Genome Research Institute under grants R01-HG00257 (to David C. Page)
and P50-HG00098 (to Eric S. Lander).<br />
<br />
Primer3 was originally written by Helen J. Skaletsky (Howard Hughes
Medical Institute, Whitehead Institute) and Steve Rozen (Duke-NUS
Graduate Medical School Singapore, formerly Whitehead Institute)
based on the design of earlier versions, notably Primer 0.5
(Steve Lincoln, Mark Daly, and Eric S. Lander).
The original web interface was designed by Richard Resnick.  Lincoln
Stein designed Boulder-IO format in the days before XML and RDF, and
championed the idea of making primer3 a software component, which
has been key to its wide utility.
In addition, among others, Ernst
Molitor, Carl Foeller, and James Bonfield contributed to the early
design of primer3. 
<br />
<br />
Primer3 is now operating as an open software development project hosted
on SourceForge, and we are working out how to acknowledge all who have
contributed to its enhancement.  Current active developers can be
found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/primer3/.</p>]]>

	<head>BUILDING A Mac OSX UNIVERSAL BINARY</head>
	<text>
<![CDATA[<p>** To build a processor-native, NON-universal binary of primer3, 
the following is NOT necessary**.<br />
<br />
The instructions above should be sufficient.<br />
<br />
A pre-compiled, universal binary download for OSX is available from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/primer3/ for the current release.<br />
<br />
These instructions assume you want to build binaries compatible 
with *both* of the current processor architectures used by the Apple
platform (i,e. the binaries will be run on both PPC and Intel platforms).<br />
<br />
Provided you have the OS X developer tools installed
(you can download from http://developer.apple.com after
registering for a free account), you can compile a universal
build (Intel and PPC native) of primer3.<br />
<br />
o you must be running OS X > 10.4 and should have the most
	recent version of XCode<br />
o run `make -f Makefile.OSX.Leopard all` if you run OS X 10.5<br />
o run `make -f Makefile.OSX.Tiger all` is you run OS X 10.4<br />
o run the tests as directed above<br />
<br />
Additional instructions for 'installing' the binaries may be found in
the README.OSX.txt.<br />
<br />
You should be able to compile a 3-way binary which includes PPC64 support 
(Intel, PPC, PPC64) by adding the `-arch ppc64` flag to the 
end of both the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS lines at the top of Makefile.OSX.  
This has not been tested.</p>]]>

	<head>HOW PRIMER3 CALCULATES THE PENALTY VALUE</head>
	<text>
<![CDATA[<p>The penalty values in are the most important value of each primer,
because primer3 uses it to choose which primers to select. The 
calculation can be influenced by the weights which allows to 
fine-tune the selection of primers to your needs.<br />
<br />
This section will explain the selection process of primers by 
primer3. In general the selection is a multi step process:<br />
<br />
In the first step, primer3 evaluates every primer that 
can be picked in the region of interest, possibly subject to
constraints due to target regions, product size ranges, and
so forth, that might preclude the use of primers in the
eventually selected primer pairs. In this pass the hard 
limits are tested like <p3t>PRIMER_MAX_GC</p3t> or <p3t>PRIMER_MIN_TM</p3t>. Primers 
with a GC lower than <p3t>PRIMER_MAX_GC</p3t> or a Tm higher than 
<p3t>PRIMER_MIN_TM</p3t> are memorized, the primers which fail in one of 
these tests are excluded. Primer3 can be forced to use primers 
failing to pass this test by setting <p3t>PRIMER_PICK_ANYWAY</p3t> to one 
(only available for primers provided by the user).<br />
<br />
In the second step, primer3 calculates a penalty for each
primer. This penalty is the only score by which primer3 
evaluates the primers It is also provided as output 
<p3t>PRIMER_LEFT_4_PENALTY</p3t>, <p3t>PRIMER_INTERNAL_4_PENALTY</p3t> and 
<p3t>PRIMER_RIGHT_4_PENALTY</p3t> (shown for the fifth primer set). For each 
primer, it is calculated like that:</p>

<h3>Left Primers:</h3>
<pre>
<p3t>PRIMER_LEFT_4_PENALTY</p3t> =

   <p3t>If PRIMER_LEFT_4_TM</p3t> &gt; <p3t>PRIMER_OPT_TM</p3t> then this is added (+):

   If <p3t>PRIMER_LEFT_4_TM</p3t> &lt; <p3t>PRIMER_OPT_TM</p3t> then this is added (+):

            ( <p3t>PRIMER_OPT_SIZE</p3t> - &lt;primer length&gt; )

<![CDATA[<p>Some of the most important issues in primer picking can be
addressed only before using primer3. These are sequence quality 
(including making sure the sequence is not vector and not chimeric) 
and avoiding repetitive elements.<br />
<br />
Techniques for avoiding problems include a thorough understanding
of possible vector contaminants and cloning artifacts coupled
with database searches using blast, Fasta, or other similarity
searching program to screen for vector contaminants and possible
repeats.  Repbase (J. Jurka, A.F.A. Smit, C. Pethiyagoda, and
others, 1995-1996, <link>ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repository/repbase</link>)
is an excellent source of repeat sequences and pointers to the
literature.  (The Repbase files need to be converted to Fasta format
before they can be used by primer3.) Primer3 now allows you to screen
candidate oligos against a Mispriming Library (or a Mishyb Library in
the case of internal oligos).<br />
<br />
Sequence quality can be controlled by manual trace viewing and
quality clipping or automatic quality clipping programs.  Low-
quality bases should be changed to N's or can be made part of
Excluded Regions. The beginning of a sequencing read is often
problematic because of primer peaks, and the end of the read
often contains many low-quality or even meaningless called bases.
Therefore, when picking primers from single-pass sequence it is
often best to use the <p3t>SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION</p3t> parameter to 
ensure that primer3 chooses primers in the high quality region 
of the read.<br />
<br />
In addition, primer3 takes as input a <p3t>SEQUENCE_QUALITY</p3t> list for
use with those base calling programs (e.g. Phred)
that output this information.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>One might be interested in performing PCR on an STS with a CA
repeat in the middle of it. Primers need to be chosen based on
the criteria of the experiment.<br />
<br />
We need to create a Boulder-IO record to send to primer3 via
stdin. There are lots of ways to accomplish this. We could save
the record into a text file called 'example', and then type the
Unix command 'primer3_core &lt; example'.<br />
<br />
Let's look at the input record itself:
<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_ID</p3t>=example<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</p3t>=GTAGTCAGTAGACNATGACNACTGACGATGCAGACNACACACACACACACAGCACACAGGTATTAGTGGGCCATTCGATCCCGACCCAAATCGATAGCTACGATGACG<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_TARGET</p3t>=37,21<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_TASK</p3t>=pick_detection_primers<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER</p3t>=1<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO</p3t>=1<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER</p3t>=1<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_OPT_SIZE</p3t>=18<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_MIN_SIZE</p3t>=15<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_MAX_SIZE</p3t>=21<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_MAX_NS_ACCEPTED</p3t>=1<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE</p3t>=75-100<br />
<p3t>P3_FILE_FLAG</p3t>=1<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_INTERNAL_EXCLUDED_REGION</p3t>=37,21<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_EXPLAIN_FLAG</p3t>=1<br />
=<br />
<br />
A breakdown of the reasoning behind each of the TAG=VALUE pairs
is below:<br />
<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_ID</p3t>=example<br />
<br />
The main intent of this tag is to provide an identifier for the
sequence that is meaningful to the user, for example when primer3
processes multiple records, and by default this tag is optional.
However, this tag is _required_ when <p3t>P3_FILE_FLAG</p3t> is non-0
Because it provides the names of the files that contain lists
of oligos that primer3 considered.<br />
<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</p3t>=GTAGTCAGTAGACNATGACNACTGACGATGCAGACNACACACACACACACAGCACACAGGTATTAGTGGGCCATTCGATCCCGACCCAAATCGATAGCTACGATGACG<br />
<br />
The <p3t>SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</p3t> provides the sequence
from which primer3 will design primers.
Note that there is no newline until the sequence terminates completely.<br />
<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_TARGET</p3t>=37,21<br />
<br />
There is a simple sequence repeat in this sequence.
The repeat starts
at base 37, and has a length of 21 bases. We instruct primer3 to
choose primers that flank the repeat site (because
we want to use the PCR product for 
determining the length of the repeat, which is likely to be polymorphic).
<br />
<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_TASK</p3t>=pick_detection_primers<br />
<br />
The <p3t>PRIMER_TASK</p3t> tells primer3 which 
type of primers to pick. You can select typical primers for PCR 
detection, primers for cloning or for sequencing.<br />
<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER</p3t>=1<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO</p3t>=1<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER</p3t>=1<br />
<br />
We would like to pick a left primer, an internal oligo and a 
right primer, so we set these flags to 1 (true). In combination 
with the <p3t>PRIMER_TASK</p3t> this tags control which primers are 
picked.<br />
<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_OPT_SIZE</p3t>=18<br />
<br />
Since our sequence length is rather small (only 108 bases long), 
we lower the <p3t>PRIMER_OPT_SIZE</p3t> from 20 to 18. It is 
more likely that primer3 will succeed if it aims for smaller
primers.<br />
<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_MIN_SIZE</p3t>=15<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_MAX_SIZE</p3t>=21<br />
<br />
With the lowering of optimal primer size, it's good to lower
the minimum and maximum sizes as well.<br />
<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_MAX_NS_ACCEPTED</p3t>=1<br />
<br />
Since the sequence is short with a
non-negligible amount of unknown bases (N's) in it, we
make primer3's job easier by allowing it to pick primers that have
at most 1 unknown base.<br />
<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE</p3t>=75-100<br />
<br />
We reduce the product size range from the default of 100-300
because our source sequence is only 108 base pairs long.  If we
insisted on a product size of 100 base pairs primer3 would have
few possibilities to choose from.<br />
<br />
<p3t>P3_FILE_FLAG</p3t>=1<br />
<br />
Because we have a short sequence with many Ns and
with a simple sequence repeat that we must amplify,
primer3 might fail to
pick and primers. Therefore, we want to get the list of primers it
considered, so that we could manually pick primers
ourselves if primer3 fails to do so. Setting this flag to 1
asks primer3 to output the primers it considered to a
forwar primers and reverse primers to output files.<br />
<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_INTERNAL_EXCLUDED_REGION</p3t>=37,21<br />
<br />
Normally CA-repeats make poor hybridization probes (because they
not specific enough).  Therefore, we exclude the CA repeat (which
is the TARGET) from consideration for the internal oligo.<br />
<br />
<p3t>PRIMER_EXPLAIN_FLAG</p3t>=1<br />
<br />
We want to see statistics about the oligos and oligo triples
(left primer, internal oligo, right primer) that primer3
examined.<br />
<br />
=<br />
<br />
The '=' character terminates the record.<br />
<br />
There were many Boulder-IO input tags that were not
specified, 
which is legal.  For the tags with default 
values, those defaults will be used in the analysis. For the 
tags with NO default values (for example <p3t>SEQUENCE_TARGET</p3t>), the 
functionality requested by the those tags will be absent. 
Also, please note 
that it is not the case that we need to surround a simple sequence 
repeat every time we want to pick primers!</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Try relaxing various parameters, including the
self-complementarity parameters and max and min oligo melting
temperatures.  For example, for very A-T-rich regions you might
have to increase maximum primer size or decrease minimum melting
temperature.  It is usually unwise to reduce the minimum primer
size if your template is complex (e.g. a mammalian genome), since
small primers are more likely to be non-specific.  Make sure that
there are adequate stretches of non-Ns in the regions in which
you wish to pick primers.  If necessary you can also allow an N
in your primer and use an oligo mixture containing all four bases
at that position.<br />

<![CDATA[<p>Primer3 can read global settings from a text file at program 
start up. This allows the user to save and exchange settings 
tailored to special applications.<br />
<br />
Such a primer3 settings file is a text file. The first three 
lines of the file have to be as described below followed by tags 
as they would be provided at standard input:</p>
<pre>
Primer3 File - http://primer3.sourceforge.net
P3_FILE_TYPE=settings

P3_FILE_ID=Description of the settings
SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE=ATG...
...
...
...
=
</pre> 
<p>
In the first line "Primer3 File - http://primer3.sourceforge.net" 
without tailing space. In the second line "P3_FILE_TYPE=settings".
Valid values for P3_FILE_TYPE are all_parameters, sequence and 
settings. Up to now, only settings is supported. The third line 
has to be empty. It is strongly advised to describe the settings 
using the P3_FILE_ID tag. It will print the description of the 
settings on the output. From the fourth line on regular 
Boulder-IO can be used as it is used in regular input. It also 
has to be terminated with a single "=". There can be only one 
input per file.</p>]]>

	<id>globalTags</id>
	<head>"GLOBAL" INPUT TAGS</head>
	<text>
<![CDATA[<p>"Global" input tags start with PRIMER_... and describe the 
general parameters that primer3 should use in its searches. 
The values of these tags persist between input Boulder 
records until or unless they are explicitly reset. Errors 
in "Global" input tags are fatal because they invalidate 
the basic conditions under which primers are being picked.<br />
<br />
Because the laboratory detection step using internal oligos is 
independent of the PCR amplification procedure, internal oligo 
tags have defaults that are independent of the parameters that 
govern the selection of PCR primers. For example, the melting 
temperature of an oligo used for hybridization might be 
considerably lower than that used as a PCR primer.

<![CDATA[<p>By default, primer3 accepts input in Boulder-IO format, a
pre-XML, pre-RDF, text-based input/output format for
program-to-program data interchange.  By default, primer3 also
produces output in the same format.<br />
<br />
When run with the -format_output command-line flag, primer3
prints a more user-oriented report for each sequence.<br />
<br />
Primer3 exits with 0 status if it operates correctly.  See EXIT
STATUS CODES below for additional information.<br />
<br />
The syntax of the version of Boulder-IO recognized by primer3 is
as follows:</p>
<pre>
  o Input consists of a sequence of RECORDs.

  o A RECORD consists of a sequence of (TAG,VALUE) pairs, each terminated
    by a newline character (\n). A RECORD is terminated by  '='
    appearing by itself on a line.

  o A (TAG,VALUE) pair has the following requirements:

    o the TAG must be immediately (without spaces) 
          followed by '='.
</pre>
<p>An example of a legal (TAG,VALUE) pair is<br />
<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_ID</p3t>=my_marker<br />
<br />
and an example of a Boulder-IO record is<br />
<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_ID</p3t>=test1<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</p3t>=GACTGATCGATGCTAGCTACGATCGATCGATGCATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTGCTAGC<br />
=<br />
<br />
Many records can be sent, one after another. Below is an example
of three different records which might be passed through a
Boulder-IO stream:<br />
<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_ID</p3t>=test1<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</p3t>=GACTGATCGATGCTAGCTACGATCGATCGATGCATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTGCTAGC<br />
=<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_ID</p3t>=test2<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</p3t>=CATCATCATCATCGATGCTAGCATCNNACGTACGANCANATGCATCGATCGT<br />
=<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_ID</p3t>=test3<br />
<p3t>SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</p3t>=NACGTAGCTAGCATGCACNACTCGACNACGATGCACNACAGCTGCATCGATGC<br />
=<br />
<br />
Primer3 reads Boulder-IO on stdin and echos its input and returns
results in Boulder-IO format on stdout.  Primer3 indicates many
user-correctable errors by a value in the output tag <p3t>PRIMER_ERROR</p3t>
(see below).  Primer3 indicates other errors, including system configuration
errors, resource errors (such out-of-memory errors), and detected
programming errors by a message on stderr and a non-zero exit
status.<br />
<br />
This document lists the input tags that primer3 recognizes.
Primer3 echos and ignores any tags it does not recognize, unless
the -strict_tags flag is set on the command line, in which case
primer3 prints an error in the <p3t>PRIMER_ERROR</p3t> output tag (see
below), and prints additional information on stdout; this option
can be useful for debugging systems that incorporate primer3.<br />
<br />
Except for tags with the type "interval list" each tag should only
appear ONCE in any given input record.  This restriction is not
systematically checked, and if a tag appears more than once, the
new value silently over-writes the previous value.

<![CDATA[<p>Unzip and untar the distribution.
DO NOT do this on a PC if you are going to
compile and/or test on a different operation system.
Primer3_core will not compile 
and various tests will fail if pc
newlines get inserted into the code and test files.  Instead, move the
distribution (primer3_&lt;release&gt;.tar.gz) to Unix/Linux, and then<br />
<br />
$ unzip primer3_1.0.1.tar.gz<br />
$ tar xvf primer3_1.0.1.tar<br />
$ cd primer3_1.0.1/src<br />
<br />
If you do not use gcc, then you will probably have 
to modify the makefile to
use your (ANSI) C compiler with the compile
and link flags it understands.<br />
<br />
$ make all<br />
<br />
# You should have created executables primer3_core, ntdpal,<br />
# olgotm, and long_seq_tm_test<br />
<br />
$ make test<br />
<br />
# You should not see 'FAILED' during the tests.<br />
<br />
If your perl command is not called perl (for example, if it is
called perl5) you will have to modify the 
Makefile in the test/ directory.<br />
<br />
ntdpal (NucleoTide Dynamic Programming ALignment) is a
stand-alone program that provides primer3's alignment
functionality (local, a.k.a. Smith-Waterman, global,
a.k.a. Needleman-Wunsch, plus "half global").  It is provided

<![CDATA[<p>How to install this software<br />
============================<br />
<br />
1.  Double click on the .tar.gz file to extract the archive.<br />
<br />
2.  The binary files are located in the 'bin' [for 'binary'] 
    folder<br />
<br />
3.  (Optional) To run the tests, cd to the new directory and 
    then the test folder<br />
<br />
4.  (Optional) Within this folder run:
	a. 'perl -w p3test.pl'<br />
<br />
5.  (Optional) You should not see 'FAILED' during the tests.<br />
<br />
6.  (Optional) *NOTE*:  If your perl command is not called 
    perl (for example, if it is called perl5) you will have 
    to modify the internals of the test scripts).<br />
<br />
7.	Copy the following files to a location of your choice:<br />
	a.  bin/long_seq_tm_test<br />
	b.  bin/ntdpal<br />
	c.  bin/oligotm<br />
	d.  bin/primer3_core<br />
<br />
8.	(Optional) Make sure this location is within your $PATH 
    (see below)<br />
<br />
<br />
Where to put the binary files<br />
=============================<br />
<br />
A good place to put these is within ~/bin/ (this means in 
your home folder, within a folder named `bin` [for 'binary']).<br />
<br />
You can also just drag the 'bin' folder to a location within 
your home directory.<br />
<br />
You can certainly also copy the files within 'bin' to 
/usr/local/bin (if you are an administrator) or another 
similar location.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the permissions on the binaries if 
you get fancy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Add the location to your $PATH<br />
==============================<br />
<br />
This is an optional step, but it will allow you to run 
primer3 in any directory on your machine as your user just 
by typing its name (primer3_core).<br />
<br />
*** You should be very careful when altering your $PATH as 
things can go very wrong.  See below for an alternate 
method. *** <br />
<br />
If you added the binaries to /usr/local/bin, then you do 
not need to do this.<br />
<br />
If you added the binaries to a local directory (let's say 
~/bin/), do the following:<br />
<br />
	1.  Edit your ~/.bash_profile.  You can edit this on 
        the command line (Terminal) with:<br />
<br />
		nano ~/.bash_profile<br />
<br />
	2. Add the following line if it is not present 
       (replacing '~/bin' if you used another directory):<br />
<br />
		PATH=$PATH:~/bin/<br />
<br />
	3. If a PATH line *is* present, ensure you add a colon 
       to the end of what is there and then the directory, 
       so if you have something like:<br />
<br />
		a) PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/genome/bin:/sw/bin<br />
<br />
       make it look like:<br />
<br />
		b) PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/genome/bin:/sw/bin:~/bin<br />
<br />
	4. Quit and restart terminal for the changes to take 
       effect.<br />
<br />	
If you don't add the location to your $PATH<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
Assuming you don't want to modify your $PATH, you can still 
run the binaries.  Let's assume you put the files in 
'~/bin/.  You may run primer3_core by doing either of the 
following:<br />
<br />
	1. ~/bin/primer3_core &lt; yourInputFile<br />
	2. /Users/&lt;your username&gt;/bin/primer3_core < yourInputFile<br />
<br />
The first option is just a shortcut to the second.</p>]]>

	<text>
<![CDATA[<p>How to install this software<br />
============================<br />
<br />
1. Unzip the '.zip' file downloaded from SourceForge.net<br />
2. You will create a primer3-1.1.3 folder in the location 
   where the file was unzipped<br />
3. You may copy the files from the 'bin' directory of the 
   primer3-1.1.3 folder to a location of your choice.  
   The exact same files are located within the 'src' folder 
   so that the tests may be run (windows does not allow 
   relative paths in shortcuts).<br />
<br />
Running the tests<br />
=================<br />
We are working on integrating the test suite to windows.  
However, substantial differences between windows and 
Unix/Linux require some differences in the test script.<br />
<br />
You must also install a perl distribution to run the 
windows tests.<br />
<br />
We *strongly* recommend you install ActiveState perl 
(http://www.activestate.com/products/activeperl/) 
as this was used to test our primer3 builds, and it is 
known to work.<br />
<br />
1. Click on 'Start > Run...'<br />
2. Type 'cmd' into the space provided<br />
3. Hit enter (or select 'OK')<br />
4. Navigate to the location of the tests:<br />
<br />
    A. if you put it in <br />
    C:/Documents and Settings/YourName/primer3-1.1.3/test/,<br />
    you would type <br />
    'cd c:/Documents and Settings/YourName/primer3-1.1.3/test/'<br />
    <br />
    B. you can also type 'cd ' (don't forget the space 
    after cd) and drag the primer3-1.1.3 folder onto the 
    command-line window from windows explorer, this will 
    fill in the location for you<br />
<br />
5. On the command line, run 'perl p3test.pl --windows' in this 
   directory<br />
6. You should see [OK] for all of the tests.<br />
<br />
Running the software<br />
====================<br />
<br />
To run the program, you must do so from the MS-DOS 
command-line.  The intricacies of the DOS command line are 
beyond the scope of this document.  Google for more 
information, if needed.  Here is a quick summary:<br />
<br />
1. Click on 'Start > Run...'<br />
2. Type 'cmd' into the space provided<br />
3. Hit enter (or select 'OK')<br />
4. Navigate to the location of the binary:<br />
<br />
    A. if you put it in<br />
    C:/Documents and Settings/YourName/Temp,<br />
    you would type <br />
    'cd c:/Documents and Settings/YourName/Temp'<br />
<br />
    B. you can also type 'cd ' (don't forget the space 
    after cd) and drag the primer3 folder onto the 
    command-line window from windows explorer, this will 
    fill in the location for you<br />
<br />
5. Run the example file by typing:<br />
<br />
    primer3_core.exe < example<br />
<br />
Other files may be run in a similar fashion.  If your input 
filename is 'MyData.txt' you can run primer3 using this 
file (in the correct format; see README) with:<br />
<br />
    primer3_core.exe < MyData.txt<br />
<br />
If your file is not in the folder containing 
primer3_core.exe, you could run the program from the 
primer3_core folder using:<br />
<br />
    primer3_core.exe < c:/someOtherFolder/someOtherFolder/MyData.txt<br />
<br />
Finally, if you want to run the program without going to 
its folder, assuming primer3_core.exe is in c:/Temp, you 
could run:<br />
<br />
    c:/Temp/primer3_core.exe < c:/someOtherFolder/someOtherFolder/MyData.txt</p>]]>

Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research provides a basic
web-based front end to primer3 named primer3web at
<link>http://fokker.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi</link><br />

	<head>INVOKING primer3_core</head>
	<text>
<![CDATA[<p>By default, the executable program produced by the Makefile is
called primer3_core.  This is the C program that does the heavy
lifting of primer picking.  There is also a more user-friendly
web interface (distributed separately).<br />
<br />
The command line for primer3 is:<br />
<br />
primer3_core [ -format_output ] [ -strict_tags ] < input_file.txt<br />
<br />
A complete list of valid command line tags can be found in 
COMMAND LINE TAGS below.<br />
<br />
WARNING: primer3_core only reads its input on stdin, so the usual
Unix convention of<br />
<br />
primer3_core input_file.txt<br />
<br />
*will not work*.  Primer3_core will just sit there forever
waiting for its input on stdin.</p>]]>

	<head>FAIR USE OF PRIMER3</head>
	<text>
<![CDATA[<p>
The development of primer3 is promoted by a small group of 
enthusiastic scientists mainly in their free time.They do not gain 
any financial profit with primer3.<br />
<br />
There are two groups of primer3 users: end users, who run 
primer3 to pick their primers and programmers, who use primer3 
in their scripts or software packages. We encourage both to use 
primer3.
<br />
<br />
If you are an end user, we request but do not
require that use of this software be cited in publications
as listed above under CITING PRIMER3.
<br />
<br />
If you are a programmer, you  will see that primer3 is now 
distributed under the GNU  General Public License, version 2 or 
(at  your option) any later version of the License (GPL2). 

As we understand it, if you include parts of the primer3 source 
code in your source code or link to primer3 binary libraries in 
your executable, you have to release your software also under 
GPL2. If you only call primer3 from your software and interpret 
its output, you can use any license you want for your software. 
If you modify primer3 and then release your modified software, 
you have to release your modifications in source code under 
GPL2 as well.
<br />
<br />
We chose GPL2 because we wanted primer3 to evolve and for the 
improvements to find their way back into the main distribution. 

So if you make useful enhancements, please contact us: 
http://primer3.sourceforge.net/contact.php

If you are programming a new web interface which runs primer3, 
please include in the about page of the tool the sentence 
"&lt;your software name&gt; uses primer3 version ...". 
Please consider releasing your software under GPL2 as well, 
especially if you do not want to maintain it in the future. 
<br />
<br />
There is no need to ask us for permission to include primer3 
in your tools, 

If there are any issues / bugs / suggestions for 
primer3, please let us know so we can improve it:
http://primer3.sourceforge.net/contact.php</p>]]>

	<head>HOW TO MIGRATE TAGS TO IO VERSION 4</head>
	<text>
<![CDATA[<p>With primer3 release 2.0, many Boulder-IO tags were 
modified and new tags were introduced. The new primer3 tags are 
designed with the idea in mind that computer scripts and other 
programs use primer3_core. The modifications make it easier for 
programs to read and write primer3 input and output.<br />
<br />
For temporary backward compatibility a command line argument 
(-io_version=3) allows the use of primer3 tags the are nearly 
identical to the previous version. However, new functionality 
is not available with the old tags. 

Furthermore the primer3 default values and the use of 
<p3t>PRIMER_WT_TEMPLATE_MISPRIMING</p3t> and <p3t>PRIMER_PAIR_WT_TEMPLATE_MISPRIMING</p3t>
have changed in version 2.0. 

The backward compatibility might be dropped in the next 
release of primer3.<br />
<br />
There are three classes of input: "Sequence" input tags describe 
a particular input sequence to primer3, and are reset after 
every Boulder record (now starting with SEQUENCE_).  "Global" 
input tags describe the general parameters that primer3 should 
use in its searches, and the values of these tags persist 
between input Boulder records until or unless they are 
explicitly reset (now starting with PRIMER_). "Program" 
parameters that deal with the behavior of the primer3 program 
itself (now starting with P3_). See below for a list of the 
modified tags.<br />
<br />
The handling of PRIMER_TASK changed completely. In the past we 
used it to tell primer3 what task to perform. Now the task is 
complemented with <p3t>PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER</p3t>, 
<p3t>PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO</p3t> and <p3t>PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER</p3t>, which 
specify which primers are to be picked.<br />
<br />
These Tags are modified:<br />
<br />
The "per sequence" tags:</p>

</pre>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
OUTPUT TAGS:<br />
<br />
There are three big changes on the output:<br />
- INTERNAL_OLIGO is now replaced by INTERNAL.<br />
- The first version is numbered 0.<br />
- The "PRODUCT" tags are renamed<br />
- The errors are modified<br />
- Errors caused by a specific primer are given as <p3t>PRIMER_LEFT_4_PROBLEMS</p3t><br />
<br />
Now all primer related output follows the rule:
PRIMER_{LEFT,RIGHT,INTERNAL,PAIR}_&lt;j&gt;_&lt;tag_name&gt;.
where &lt;j&gt; is an integer from 0 to n, where n is at most the 
value of <p3t>PRIMER_NUM_RETURN</p3t> - 1.<br />
<br />
This allows easy scripting by using the underscores _ to split 
the name. The first part is PRIMER, the second the type of oligo 
or pair parameters, the third is always a number, starting at 
0 and the rest is used by the tags.<br />
<br />
That affects also (shown for output nr. 5):</p>
<pre>
NEW VERSION                             - OLD VERSION

<p3t>PRIMER_PAIR_4_PRODUCT_TM_OLIGO_TM_DIFF</p3t>  - PRIMER_PRODUCT_TM_OLIGO_TM_DIFF_4 (grouped with PAIR)

<p3t>PRIMER_INTERNAL_EXPLAIN</p3t>                 - PRIMER_INTERNAL_OLIGO_EXPLAIN

PRIMER_LEFT_4_LIBRARY_MISPRIMING                   - PRIMER_LEFT_4_MISPRIMING_SCORE

<![CDATA[<p>For each Boulder-IO record passed into primer3 via stdin, exactly
one Boulder-IO record comes out of primer3 on stdout. These output
records contain everything that the input record contains, plus a
subset of the following tag/value pairs.  Unless noted by (*),
each tag appears for each primer pair returned.<br />
Tags are of the form PRIMER_{LEFT,RIGHT,INTERNAL,PAIR}_&lt;j&gt;_&lt;tag_name&gt;
where &lt;j&gt; is an integer from 0 to n, where n is at most the 
value of <p3t>PRIMER_NUM_RETURN</p3t>. In the documentation the output 
nr. 5 is shown as for example: <p3t>PRIMER_LEFT_4_TM</p3t>.<br />

In the descriptions below, 'i,n' represents a start/length pair,
's' represents a string, x represents an arbitrary integer, and f
represents a float.</p>]]>

	<head>Primer3 input tags</head>
	<text>
<![CDATA[<p>There are 3 major classes of input tags.  "Sequence" input tags
starting with SEQUENCE_... describe a particular input sequence 
to primer3, and are reset after every Boulder record.  "Global" 
input tags starting with PRIMER_... describe the general parameters 
that primer3 should use in its searches, and the values of these 
tags persist between input Boulder records until or unless they 
are explicitly reset. The third class of P3_... tags describe 
parameters which modify the way primer3 provides the output (for 
example as separate files) and do not influence the primer selection 
itself.<br />
Tags which do not start with SEQUENCE_, PRIMER_ or P3_ are ignored 
by primer3.<br />
  Errors in "Sequence" input tags invalidate the current record, 
but primer3 will continue to process additional records.<br />
  Errors in "Global" input tags are fatal because they invalidate 
the basic conditions under which primers are being picked.<br />
<br />
Because the laboratory detection step using internal oligos is 
independent of the PCR amplification procedure, internal oligo 
tags have defaults that are independent of the parameters that 
govern the selection of PCR primers. For example, the melting 
temperature of an oligo used for hybridization might be 
considerably lower than that used as a PCR primer.</p>]]>
